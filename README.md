### Hi there üëã

I have built my professional profile around two different domains of expertise.

First, _the human domain_: **social sciences, psychology and humanities**. I hold a Ph.D. in cognitive sciences (cognitive technologies, information management and complex systems) and I polished my skills in activity analysis at the EDF R&D [Laboratory of Design for Cognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZVIpNgZqoo) and later the Airbus human factor R&T Department. I focused mainly on HCI. I also led for 3 years a [seminar](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0539018410371266) focused on new methods in activity analysis at EHESS ([Ecole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales](https://www.ehess.fr/en)) with Professor Saadi Lahlou.

Second, _the technical domain_: **software development and engineering**. I have been working for 15 years on innovative software development projects with high-profile academic teams ([Stanford SCIL](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin0809/5425.htm), [San Diego CogSi](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/)...) or industrial groups. I have also been involved in several other personal or professional projects, ranging from Natural Language Processing software using .net to full stack js web app projects & infrastructures.

After nearly 10 years of freelancing for all kinds of clients (mostly solo on big projects, sometimes in a team), I am now CTO of the [Paris Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.paris-iea.fr/en/) since early 2020. The projects we work on are all non-profit and promote the common good, open science and open data in general. We are trying to address the current and upcoming challenges of our world by designing tools to help as many people as we can contribute to overcoming these situations.

My involvement in the open science world and open scholarly communication led me to coordinate the [special interest group Tools and Platforms](https://operas-eu.org/special-interest-groups/tools-and-platforms/) of the Operas European research infrastructure.

I am also the tech lead of a massive project studying the food transition called the Food Socioscope. Part of the job involves using fine-tuned machine learning technologies for speech-to-text, speaker diarization, summarisation, translation, and many other purposes.

Finally, I designed and realized 2 original infrastructure generators: the Netboard and Publio. 

- The netboard is an IaC-based engine to produce 100% serverless cloud infrastructures able to tackle massive traffic. It is powered by graphQL APIs, a fleet of lambda-based microservices, a MongoDB database and a dozen of other types of components, all automatically deployed and maintained using a refined CI/CD approach. It has been in production with several domains for nearly 4 years without a glitch.

- Publio is a one-of-a-kind low-cost low-tech type of infrastructure. It mostly features a CI-based content generation capability that will push content into its own repository while building static websites. It produces document libraries, FTS indexes, thumbnails, filters, bibliographies, and many other things; and disseminates content using third-party platforms such as Zenodo, OpenAire or, in a close future, HAL. While it was initially meant to be a tool dedicated to Institutes for Advanced Study, the universities and research practitioners have seen it as a game changer in the scientific publication process and are actively starting to use it.

My current and favourite stack features the following technologies and approaches:
- IaC Terraform
- Serverless microservices
- GraphQL APIs
- MongoDB/NoSQL databases
- Headless content management and generation
- And the best frontend tech depending on the task at hand, only with Vue: SSR, SSG, SPA, hybrid (SSG + Edge SSR generation)

Here are some of the publicly available websites I created recently:

#### If you feel like you can help and wish to be part of the projects we are working on, or of the ambitious platforms we are planning to develop, please [check this out](https://gist.github.com/Billybobbonnet/c952b2b19218d8ec1537820151ace3c9) & send me an email: we are always on the lookout for good developers to join to the team!

The best is yet to come! üçÄ üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üöÄ üòÑ
